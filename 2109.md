Play with some exercies on os, logging, argparse, *argv and **kwargs.<br>
A useful website: https://pymotw.com/2/contents.html <br>
It has many basic level of the Python library, but it's too detailed so referring to the website is enough.

Fix the code, the training results look bad.
Need to figure out how to cross validation and do the plotting.
Corey Shafer has good Python vedios on YouTube.

Last model took 15 hours to run, the output: <br>
> 2021-09-06 12:36:07,434 192.168.0.1 lw      (Train_Nnet_Reg)[131]: The neural network training took 53874.44690489769s. <br>
> 2021-09-06 12:36:15,565 192.168.0.1 lw      (Train_Nnet_Reg)[147]: The best_index 6675 with training R-sqaure as 0.8650941905354578, validation R-square as 0.08469912635937005, and training&validating R-squared as 0.26508608202870254. <br>

From the log, I doubt the model is learning. Currently working on to add the validation part.
Watched several vedios of Corey Schafer:
> Automate Parsing and Renaming of Multiple Files
> * os.chdir(), os.listdir(), os.path.splitext(), os.rename()
> * To strip whitespace, delete '#' and fill in digits: .strip()[1:].zfill(2)
> 
> Custom Sublime Text Build Systems
> * To build system, visit sublimetext documentation wibsite
> * "u": an output buffer
> * To find location of python in the terminal: which python2.6

Watched vedios of Corey Schafer:
> List Comprehension
> * my_list = [n\*n for n in nums]
> * my_list = map(lambda n: n\*n, nums) it runs everything in the list through the certain function (here is lambda)
> * my_list = [(letter, num) for letter in 'abcd' for num in range(4)]  
> * my_dict = {name: hero for name, hero in zip(names, heros)}
> * Set is kind of a list but it only has unique values, set comprehension uses {}
> * Generator: my_gen = (n\*n for n in nums)

> File Objects:
> * Use a context manager: with open('test.txt', 'r') as f:  it allows to work with files within the block and close them automatically
> * f.read(): sets the number of characters when it reads
> * f.tell: gives the current position
> * f.seek(0): it sets back to the given position when it continues to read

> OS module:
> * Common methods: os.getcwd(), os.chdir(''), os.listdir(), os.mkdir(), os.makedirs() - it can create a tree structure, os.rmdir(), os.removedirs(), os.rename(), os.stat()ï¼Œ os.path.join()(this solves the slash problem automatically), os.path.basename() / os.path.dirname(), os.path.split(), os.path.exists(), os.path.splitext()(split the root path and extension)
> * How to transform computer time to human readable time: 
> > mod_time = os.stat('demo.txt').st_mtime <br>
> > print(datatime.fromtimestamp(mod_time))
> * dir(os.path): returns all available methods of os.path module

###### 210909
Add the cross validation part, yet r^2_val and r^2_train has the same level number, this is clearly problematic. <br>
Corey Schafer:
> Matplotlib:
> * Suggestion: add label to each plot method, this is easier to read and is self documenting
> * Recommend explicit format than the short version, also recommends hex color code
> * Recommend plt.xkcd() which is a fun way to plot for a blog
> * Pie chart is more for 5 ~ 6 categories
> * Horizontal bar is preferred when x sticks has long names

###### 210910
Add the plots part into code, need to delete the flags parts.
Revised and sent Dan the annual report draft.
