Play with some exercies on os, logging, argparse, *argv and **kwargs.<br>
A useful website: https://pymotw.com/2/contents.html <br>
It has many basic level of the Python library, but it's too detailed so referring to the website is enough.

Fix the code, the training results look bad.
Need to figure out how to cross validation and do the plotting.
Corey Shafer has good Python vedios on YouTube.

Last model took 15 hours to run, the output: <br>
> 2021-09-06 12:36:07,434 192.168.0.1 lw      (Train_Nnet_Reg)[131]: The neural network training took 53874.44690489769s. <br>
> 2021-09-06 12:36:15,565 192.168.0.1 lw      (Train_Nnet_Reg)[147]: The best_index 6675 with training R-sqaure as 0.8650941905354578, validation R-square as 0.08469912635937005, and training&validating R-squared as 0.26508608202870254. <br>

From the log, I doubt the model is learning. Currently working on to add the validation part.
Watched several vedios of Corey Schafer:

> * os.chdir(), os.listdir(), os.path.splitext(), os.rename()
> * To strip whitespace, delete '#' and fill in digits: .strip()[1:].zfill(2)

Watched vedios of Corey Schafer:
> List Comprehension:
> * my_list = [n\*n for n in nums]
> * my_list = map(lambda n: n\*n, nums) it runs everything in the list through the certain function (here is lambda)
> * my_list = [(letter, num) for letter in 'abcd' for num in range(4)]
